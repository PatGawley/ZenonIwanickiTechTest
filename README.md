# IcelandTechTest
Technical Test For Iceland Integration .Net Developers

Complete class ThroughPut which ensures that throughput remains within specified upper and lower boundaries within a 24 hour period.

Use a TDD approach, an example test has been included.

Points to note: -

1. DateTime is injected to the class on instantiation to make it more testable.

2. It is a rolling 24 hour so you will need to implement some sort of tick which will clear an interval down as you enter it.

This test is for the Senior Software Developer role and was issued on 26th November 2021 for completion by close of day 2nd December 2021.

When complete, raise a PR.

Good luck.
